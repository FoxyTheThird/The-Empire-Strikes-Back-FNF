The Empire Strikes Back!!
A new FNF Mod featuring something that very few if any others have!
We have :
 - A new and fresh Gallery that even has it's own music
 - A bangin' soundtrack (TBA)
 - Some new Funky Assets
 - And Code Optimized like no other!
 - Sone new Character on the assembly line ready to get freaky on a Friday Night!
 - Some of the most dedicated team members to boot! Including: LeBipi, Majizu, NoName, Frann, Speedrunner_Doomguy (me), and our fresh new coder - FoxyTheThird!
 - Although his name is out of place this is his github and more importantly his code, so please to show some respect to him and the other team members!
 
Anyways, all that babble aside this code might be open source on day 1 if enough people care so make sure to share this mod around and build some names for the new team up to base in the FNF Community!
