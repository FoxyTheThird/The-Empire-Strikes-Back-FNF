# Empire Hijinks!!
**A new FNF Mod featuring something that very few others have!**

*We have* :
 - **_One of_ the best custom engines built off of an _amazing_ engine, none other than Psyche Engine! Thank you Shadowmario and your team for making such a _beast_ of an engine!**
 - **A _new_ and _fresh_ Gallery that has it's own music and a VideoPlayer!**
 - **A _bangin'_ soundtrack! (TBA)**
 - **Some _new_ Funky Assets!**
 - **Code Optimized like _no other_ + Some new Characters on the assembly line, ready to get freaky on a Friday Night!!**
 - **And** *Lastly*, **Some of the most dedicated team members to boot! Including: LeBipi, Majizu, NoName, Frann, Speedrunner_Doomguy (Amphis), and our fresh new coder - _FoxyTheThird/Scary_!**
   
 # **FINAL NOTE**
 - This is *his* github and more importantly *his* code, so **please** show some respect to *him* and the other team members!!
 
## All that babble aside, this code might be open source on *Day 1* if enough people care! So make sure to *share* this mod around and build some names for the *new team* up to base in the FNF Modding Community!

<sup> Thank you for viewing.
